I've created a comprehensive Bluetooth-controlled home automation system demonstration that includes all the deliverables you requested:

Circuit Diagram: Visual representation showing Arduino Uno connected to HC-05 Bluetooth module and 4-channel relay controlling various home devices.

Complete Code: Both Arduino firmware and Android app communication code with proper command handling for device control.

Working Demo: Fully functional web interface simulating the mobile app experience with real-time device control, Bluetooth connection status, and system monitoring.

The system demonstrates professional-grade home automation with smooth animations, intuitive controls, and comprehensive documentation. You can toggle between the control panel, circuit diagram, and code sections to see all aspects of the implementation.
